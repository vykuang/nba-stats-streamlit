# Streamlit

The uber pickup tutorial gave a really good overview of what it can do: [Uber pickup tutorial](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app)

It's got

- tabular view
- checkboxes to toggle which elements are visible
- charts
- sliders to filter those choarts
- maps if we give it lat/long

Pretty impressive stuff.

What do I want to show? Ultimately I'd like an interactive applet that lets the user chooose a player, run the pre-trained model on that player's stats, and return the label.

1. Raw data, after compilation?
1. Maybe a histogram for the three main stats - PTS, AST, REB, just to visualize the raw data a little
1. Player selection
1. Predicted player label
1. Visualization of how that player fits within that label?
   - How would this work?
     - AST vs REB, size=PTS scatterplot of all players with the label, with the selected player highlighted
